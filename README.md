# Blockade (Rust Bindings)
This project is an attempt to make some decent bindings for Rust to
the really neat project over at
[worstcase/blockade](https://github.com/worstcase/blockade).
The plan is to make it as simple and easy to use as possible, with
speed/throughput taking a backseat here.  To that end, it uses
synchronous HTTP calls to the REST API presented by blockade.
There's a lot more coming in the future, this is very much a work
in progress.
